Tool to help migrate a playlist out of iTunes. Very rudimentary now - will look for an m3u file
(Presumably generated by iTunes) in the current directory, and will make a new directory containing
an m3u and copies of the files in the original m3u. The new m3u points to those copies, so the new 
directory can be copied / sent etc.

TODOs:

Make it work on anything other than OS X
Support directory as a command line arg (yeah I know that one's simple)
